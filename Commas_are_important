Once upon a time, there was a family of birds who lived deep in
the woods. They were getting ready for their annual family
reunion where grandma wolf would be joining them. As they
were setting up the decorations, they realized they
were missing the most crucial part of the reunion,
which was food.

After a quick brainstorming session, they decided to take
maters into their own hands and hunt for their meal. They
spotted a plump hen and went in for the kill. As they were
celebrating their successful hunt, they heard a familiar voice.
It was grandma wolf.

With excitement, they ran to greet her. Grandma was really impressed!
With a happy look they said,
"Lets go to the kitchen and let's eat, Grandma!"

Grandma Wolf was delighted to see her family after a long
time.
